      <p>Echos is a third-person 3D adventure/puzzle game that revolves around the player who is attempting to steal a
         treasure from a ruined castle. The player will encounter skeletons of those who died in whatever conflict
          left the castle in ruin. The player will have an ability called “Echo.” This will allow them to interact with
           a skeleton to see the moments leading to their deaths, and they will then be able to take control of those characters
            and play as them in the past. The actions the player takes while controlling these characters of the past will
             affect the present. The player must utilize this ability to solve puzzles that will lead them further into the ruins.

                Siege left the castle ruined and destroyed. The MC is an outlaw. They heard of a treasure which was lost in the ruins of the castle,
                and they are exploring the ruins in order to find it. They somehow discover the Echo ability, and use it to navigate the ruins.
                At the end of the game they will face a choice between taking the treasure or leaving it be.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people were killed in the siege. The player will be able to encounter three of the perished which they can
                then use Echo on: a Knight, a Mage, and a Thief.

                Echos will have a somewhat cartoonish, yet serious art style. The general layout of the castle will remain the same
                between the past & present, but the aesthetic and design will change.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Present will have a solemn air to it, being mostly quiet and empty. The castle is in ruins, any
                life that once inhabited it having long since absconded. The game will take place on a quiet and cloudy afternoon, and
                as such the lighting will be gray and moody. The general color palette will be a mix or dark grays and light blues/greens.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Past will instead be energetic and chaotic, with distant fires and shouting in the background. As it is actively
                under siege, the castle will have sustained damage, but will still retain some of its glory as it has not yet been left
                abandoned. The scene will take place in the afternoon, the general color palette will be more shadowy oranges and yellows.

              <p>The main goal of the game is to reach the end while saving the characters along the way. The MC's main drive will most likely
                differ slightly from that of the player, as they will be driven more by the treasure than by saving the other characters.
             </p>
             <p>
               Echo, the ability which the player will use to solve puzzles, will have several functional components.
             </p>
             <ul>
               <li>During gameplay, the user will encounter skeletons in the castle with a visual aura about them.
               </li>
               <li>To use Echo, the player must walk up to a skeleton with an aura and interact with it. 
               </li>
               <li>A visual effect will take place, and the scene will change to the past.
               </li>
               <li>After a character is saved through Echo, a short cutscene will play showing them escaping their predicament,
                  and their skeleton will disappear to signify that they have been saved.
               </li>
               <li>Each character will have different mechanics available to them which the Player can utilize.
               </li>
               <li>The first time the Player switches to a new character, instead of gaining control of that character,
                  they will instead be shown a short scene of the character and their death, upon which the Echo will
                   end and the player will take back control of the MC. This will serve to introduce the player to the
                    Character, and the very first time the Player uses Echo it will reinforce that they are taking control
                     of the character in the moments before their death. Any time the player uses Echo, the player will
                      instead gain control over the character and can begin solving the puzzle.

                Echos is structured around the Global script SwitchCharacter, which is connected to an element called
                GameManager which keeps track of which character is currently being used, as well as which character is
                being switched to. Echos first loads the base player movement and controls and then uses SwitchCharacter
                to activate the correct character’s scripts, as well as set the camera to follow the correct character.
                Each character's attributes are set up in their own particular script, which is activated by SwitchCharacter.
                That character’s script then takes over, loading the correct movement, commands, abilities, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, there is a script for each character's ability, which is called by each character’s script when the ability is used.
                There are two scripts for movement: PlayerMovement and NewPlayerMovement. NewPlayerMovement is set up around the camera, PlayerMovement
                is simple tank controls. NewPlayerMovement is the primary movement control scheme used by most characters, though is less stable.
                PlayerMovement serves as a more stable base movement in case there are bugs with the regular movement. There are also scripts for
                various interactable objects.

                      The main character moves around the map to each of the skeletons and can interact with them to take control of them.
                      Each of the playable characters has the same base movement and control functionality, based on the main character;
                      a simple 3rd person camera that follows the mouse and WASD movement.

                    The Knight has two functionalities, Shield and Lift. When the player presses Q, the Knight defends himself with his shield.
                    There are also weights that the player can find. When the player presses E while next to the weight, the Knight
                    will pick up the weight and weight and can move it around with slowed movement.

                    forwards, and if it comes into contact with a box once, then the box is burnt. If a burnt box is hit by a fireball,
                    it is destroyed. Transform turns the mage into a rat, and can then fit into smaller areas

                Echos currently has a simple UI with placeholder particle effects in the background, with a ‘Play’ button, an ‘Options’ button,
                and an ‘Exit’ button, all with their features implemented. The options button brings you to the options menu, which has
                unimplemented settings that, in the finished game, the user will be able to interact with to change settings such as volume.

                The map is divided into three sections, with a puzzle in each area. The Skeletons of the other three playable characters are
                laid out in their separate rooms. There is a weight and pressure plate puzzle for the knight, a transformation puzzle for
                the wizard, and a climbing puzzle for the thief. At the end of each puzzle, the player can find a key, which they can use
                to unlock doors.

                Logan primarily worked on new camera controls and movement. He created a simple pressure plate puzzle for the knight’s
                boulder mechanic. He also playtested, looked for bugs, and reported/helped to fix them. Logan also worked with Gerald
                to create simple puzzles to show off the character mechanics.

                setting up the environment itself. Gerald set up the project in Plastic SCM so that the project could be shared with all
                four of our game developers.

                character. He made the skeleton models for the wizard, knight, and thief characters. Also, he made some prototype models
                for the characters themselves which are still being conceptualized.

                    for now, the map is all laid out in front of the player to attempt any of the current puzzles. Many new puzzles
                    will eventually be added for each section, and new mechanics will have to be implemented in order to create
                    them. For example, for puzzles pertaining to the knight’s shield ability, there will be flame obstacles
                    added which the knight would have to protect himself from.
