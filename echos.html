        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>Echos is a top down 2.5D adventure/puzzle game which revolves
           around the player taking control of a thief who is attempting
            to steal a treasure from a ruined castle. The player will
             encounter skeletons of those who died in whatever conflict
              left the castle ruined. The player will gain the ability,
               “Echo.” This will allow them to interact with a skeleton
                to see the moments leading to their deaths, and they will
                 then be able to take control of those characters and play
                  as them in the past. The actions the player takes while
                   controlling these characters of the past will affect
                    the present. The player must utilize this ability
                     to solve puzzles that will lead them further into
                      the ruins, and in the process they will save the
                       characters whom they possess.

        <h3>Story Details</h3>
        <p>Siege left the castle ruined and destroyed. The MC is an outlaw. They heard of a treasure which was lost in the ruins of the castle,
         and they are exploring the ruins in order to find it. They somehow discover the Echo ability, and use it to navigate the ruins.
          At the end of the game they will face a choice between taking the treasure or leaving it be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people were killed in the siege. The player will be able to encounter three of the perished which they can then use Echo on: a Knight, a Mage, and a Thief.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knight</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Captain of the guard, a brave and honorable individual who died trying to protect the Kingdom. This is the first character the Player will come across.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Mage</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An advisor to the crown, who was killed after they failed to cast a spell to stop the siege. They will be able to cast spells which can interact with the environment.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Thief</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An outlaw who snuck in trying to steal something from the castle but was trapped by the conflict when the siege began. The last character the Player finds.
                 The MC will find similarities between themselves and the Thief, and will lead to growth in the MC.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Art Style</h3>
        <p>Echos will have a somewhat cartoonish, yet serious art style. The general layout of the castle will remain the same
          between the past & present, but the aesthetic and design will change.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold underline">The Present</span> will have a solemn air to it, being mostly quiet and empty. The castle is in ruins, any
          life that once inhabited it having long since absconded. The game will take place on a quiet and cloudy afternoon, and
           as such the lighting will be gray and moody. The general color palette will be a mix or dark grays and light blues/greens.
         </p>
         <p>
         <span class="bold underline">The Past</span> will instead be energetic and chaotic, with distant fires and shouting in the background. As it is actively
          under siege, the castle will have sustained damage, but will still retain some of its glory as it has not yet been left
           abandoned. The scene will take place in the afternoon, the general color palette will be more shadowy oranges and yellows.
         </p>
      </div> 

      <div class="pb-5">
        <h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
        <p>The main goal of the game is to reach the end while saving the characters along the way. The MC's main drive will most likely
           differ slightly from that of the player, as they will be driven more by the treasure than by saving the other characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold underline">Echo</span>, the ability which the player will use to solve puzzles, will have several functional components.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>During gameplay, the user will encounter skeletons in the castle with a visual aura about them.
          </li>
          <li>To use Echo, the player must walk up to a skeleton with an aura and interact with it. 
          </li>
          <li>A visual effect will take place, and the scene will change to the past.
          </li>
          <li>After a character is saved through Echo, a short cutscene will play showing them escaping their predicament,
             and their skeleton will disappear to signify that they have been saved.
          </li>
          <li>Each character will have different mechanics available to them which the Player can utilize.
          </li>
          <li>The first time the Player switches to a new character, instead of gaining control of that character,
             they will instead be shown a short scene of the character and their death, upon which the Echo will
              end and the player will take back control of the MC. This will serve to introduce the player to the
               Character, and the very first time the Player uses Echo it will reinforce that they are taking control
                of the character in the moments before their death. Any time the player uses Echo, the player will
                 instead gain control over the character and can begin solving the puzzle.
          </li>
        </ul>
         
      </div> 


      <div class="pb-5">
        <h3>Characters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Each Character has unique abilities which they can use to navigate and interact with the world. Some of the actions performed
             by these characters will have permanent consequences which affect the present.
          </li>
          <li>Knight</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Can push heavy objects around.

              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Mage</li>

      <div class="pb-5">
        <h3>Example Puzzle Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The knight can move large stones into specific positions to open up new areas/to complete a basic puzzle.
          </li>
          <li>Utilize enemy weapons to solve certain puzzles. 
          </li>
          <li>Rogue can use a quick burst of speed to maneuver through certain areas on the map. (Maybe can reach areas unreachable without the speed boost).
          </li>
          <li>Simple matching/memorization minigame. 
          </li>
          <li>Mage can either create or take over a small animals movement so that he can use it to reach unreachable areas. 
          </li>
          <li>Have some items transfer from room to room that can be used to solve similar puzzles.
          </li>
        </ul>
