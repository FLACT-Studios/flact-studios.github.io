        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>Echos is a top down 2.5D adventure/puzzle game which revolves around the player taking control of a thief who is attempting
         to steal a treasure from a ruined castle. The player will encounter skeletons of those who died in whatever conflict left
          the castle ruined. The player will gain the ability, “Echo.” This will allow them to interact with a skeleton to see the
           moments leading to their deaths, and they will then be able to take control of those characters and play as them in the
            past. The actions the player takes while controlling these characters of the past will affect the present. The player
             must utilize this ability to solve puzzles that will lead them further into the ruins, and in the process they will
              save the characters whom they possess.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="pb-5">
        <h3>Story Details</h3>
        <p>Siege left the castle ruined and destroyed. The MC is an outlaw. They heard of a treasure which was lost in the ruins of the castle,
         and they are exploring the ruins in order to find it. They somehow discover the Echo ability, and use it to navigate the ruins.
          At the end of the game they will face a choice between taking the treasure or leaving it be.
        </p>
        <p>
         Three perished characters for the player to use Echo on: a Knight, a Mage, and a Thief.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knight</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Captain of the guard, a brave and honorable individual who died trying to protect the Kingdom. The first character the Player will come across.
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Mage</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An advisor to the crown, able to cast
              </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Thief</li>
            <ul>
              <li>An outlaw who snuck in trying to steal something from the castle but was trapped by the conflict when the siege began. The last character the Player finds. The MC will find similarities between themselves and the Thief, and will lead to growth in the MC
              </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>
         

        <h3>Art Style</h3>
      <p>Echos will have a somewhat cartoonish, yet serious art style. The general layout of the castle will remain the same
         between the past & present, but the aesthetic and design will change.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold underline">The Present</span> will have a solemn air to it, being mostly quiet and empty. The castle is in ruins, any
          life that once inhabited it having long since absconded. The game will take place on a quiet and cloudy afternoon, and
           as such the lighting will be gray and moody. The general color palette will be a mix or dark grays and light blues/greens.
         </p>
         <p>
         <span class="bold underline">The Past</span> will instead be energetic and chaotic, with distant fires and shouting in the background. As it is actively
          under siege, the castle will have sustained damage, but will still retain some of its glory as it has not yet been left
           abandoned. The scene will take place in the afternoon, the general color palette will be more shadowy oranges and yellows.
